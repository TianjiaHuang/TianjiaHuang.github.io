   Hello there! I'm Tianjia Huang, a dedicated fourth-year Ph.D. student specializing in Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Prof. <a href="https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/george-j-moridis/">George Moridis</a> and Prof. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html">Thomas Blasingame</a>).
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>An overview of my research</b><br>
   My research is centered around the intricate numerical simulation of subsurface energy systems, delving into diverse fields including geothermal energy, hydrogen storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS), nuclear waste disposal, and the dynamics of particle transport within porous media. Alongside this, I'm actively engaged in pioneering the development of high-performance reservoir simulation techniques. This involves leveraging cutting-edge technologies like MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to craft advanced reservoir simulators. Additionally, I specialize in parallel performance analysis, utilizing tools like <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php/">TAU performance system</a> to optimize and enhance system efficiencies.
   <br>
   My expertise lies primarily in Fortran and Matlab programming languages, which I actively apply in my modification and development of the TOUGH software suite, which is developed in <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. Within this domain, I've been extensively involved in the enhancement and parallelization of various TOUGH modules. Notably, I've played a significant role alongside Dr. Moridis in parallelizing  <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+RealGasBrine</a>, and independently developed and parallelized TOUGH+Particle Transport—comprising over 10,000 lines of code. Moreover, I am familar with TOUGH2, <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+Hydrate</a>, and TOUGH+FLAC3D.
