   Hello! My name is Tianjia Huang. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Dr. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/gmoridis.html">George Moridis</a> and Dr. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html">Thomas Blasingame</a>). Here is my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jv6h8qvno7dp75kecc15y/Resume-Tianjia-huang.pdf?rlkey=mnf78b8mk4yjp15inec5bqsyj&dl=0" download="Tianjia Huang- CV">CV</a>.

   <br>
   <b>An overview of my research</b><br>
      <li><em>Numerical modeling of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) dynamics in subsurface environment</em> 
              <br><p style="text-align:justify">I am developing and coupling modeling for a wide range of geoengineering applications, including underground hydrogen storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear waste disposal. The models are implemented using TOUGH2, <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+</a>, and TOUGH+FLAC3D.</p>
      <li><em>Numerical modeling of particle transport within porous media</em> 
              <br><p style="text-align:justify">I have employed the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to predict the solid phase behaviors by modeling and tracking the trajectories of all particles. This work attempts to solve the serious sand production issues during gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments.</p>
      <li><em>High performance computing for petroleum science</em> 
              <br><p style="text-align:justify">This leverages cutting-edge technologies. e.g., MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to craft advanced reservoir simulators. Additionally, I specialize in parallel performance analysis, utilizing tools like <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php/">TAU performance system</a> to improve system efficiencies.</p> 
   <p style="text-align:justify">
   I am proficient in the Fortran programming language, which I actively apply in the development of the TOUGH software suite from <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. Within this domain, I have been extensively involved in the enhancement and parallelization of various TOUGH modules. I have played a significant role alongside Dr. Moridis in parallelizing <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+RealGasBrine</a>. I have also independently developed and parallelized the separate Particle Transport code (over 10,000 lines).
