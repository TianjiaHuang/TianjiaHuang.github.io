   <br>
   Howdy! My name is Tianjia Huang and I am a fourth-year Ph.D student of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Prof. George Moridis and Prof. Thomas Blasingame).
   <br>
   <br>
   My research focuses on numerical simulation of subsurface energy, such as geothermal, hydrogen storage, CCUS, nuclear waste disposal, and particle transport in porous media. I am also interested in developing high-performance reservoir simulator, using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA.
   <br>
   <br>
   FORTRAN and MATLAB are two programming languages I use most often. I currently mainly use TOUGH software, which is developed in <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, inclduing TOUGH+RealGasBrine (Parallelized by Dr. Moridis and me), TOUGH+Particle Transport (Developed and parallelized by me), TOUGH+Hydrate, and TOUGH+FLAC3D.
