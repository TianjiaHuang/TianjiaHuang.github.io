   Hello! My name is Tianjia Huang. I am from China. Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Prof. <a href="https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/george-j-moridis/">George Moridis</a> and Prof. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html">Thomas Blasingame</a>). 
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>An overview of my research</b><br>
   <p style="text-align:justify">
      <li>The numerical modeling of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes in subsurface energy systems. I am familiar with TOUGH2, <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+</a>, and TOUGH+FLAC3D. I enjoy developing and coupling modeling to a wide range of geoengineering applications, including underground hydrogen storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear waste disposal.
      <br>
      <li>The numerical modeling of the dynamics of particle transport within porous media. I employ the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a numerical technique formulated in the Lagrangian frame, to predict the solid phase behaviors by modeling and tracking the trajectory of individual particles. This is a project from the Department of Energy that funded my PhD research.
      <br>
      <li>The development of high-performance reservoir simulation techniques. This involves leveraging cutting-edge technologies like MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to craft advanced reservoir simulators. Additionally, I specialize in parallel performance analysis, utilizing tools like <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php/">TAU performance system</a> to optimize and enhance system efficiencies.
      <br>
      <li>I am proficient in the Fortran programming language, which I actively apply in the modification and development of the TOUGH software suite, developed at <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. Within this domain, I've been extensively involved in the enhancement and parallelization of various TOUGH modules. Notably, I've played a significant role alongside Dr. Moridis in parallelizing <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+RealGasBrine</a> and independently developed and parallelized Particle Transport code, comprising over 10,000 lines of code.
