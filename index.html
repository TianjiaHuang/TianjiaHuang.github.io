   Hello there! I'm Tianjia Huang, a dedicated fourth-year Ph.D. student specializing in Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Prof. <a href="https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/george-j-moridis/">George Moridis</a> and Prof. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html">Thomas Blasingame</a>).
   <br>
   <br>
   <b>An overview of my research</b><br>
   My research focuses on numerical simulation of subsurface energy, such as geothermal, hydrogen storage, CCS, nuclear waste disposal, and particle transport in porous media. I am also developing high-performance reservoir simulator (inclduing MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA) and parallel performance analysis (using <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php/">TAU performance system</a>)
   <br>
   Fortran and Matlab are two programming languages I am most familiar with. I currently mainly use (modify and develop) TOUGH software, which is developed in <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>, inclduing <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+RealGasBrine</a> (Parallelized by Dr. Moridis and me), TOUGH2, TOUGH+Particle Transport (Developed and parallelized independently by me, more than 10,000 lines of code), <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+Hydrate</a>, and TOUGH+FLAC3D.
