   Hello! My name is Tianjia Huang. I am from China. Currently, I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University (Advisor: Prof. <a href="https://eesa.lbl.gov/profiles/george-j-moridis/">George Moridis</a> and Prof. <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/petroleum/profiles/tblasingame.html">Thomas Blasingame</a>). Please feel free to download my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jv6h8qvno7dp75kecc15y/Resume-Tianjia-huang.pdf?rlkey=mnf78b8mk4yjp15inec5bqsyj&dl=0" download="Tianjia Huang- CV">CV</a> here.

   <b>An overview of my research</b><br>
   <p style="text-align:justify">
      <li><em>Numerical modeling of coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes in subsurface energy systems</em> 
              <br>I am familiar with TOUGH2, <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+</a>, and TOUGH+FLAC3D. I enjoy developing and coupling modeling to a wide range of geoengineering applications, including underground hydrogen storage, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear waste disposal.
      <br>
      <li><em>Numerical modeling of the dynamics of particle transport within porous media</em> 
              <br>I employ the Discrete Element Method (DEM), a numerical technique formulated in the Lagrangian frame, to predict the solid phase behaviors by modeling and tracking the trajectory of individual particles. This is the project from the Department of Energy that funded my PhD study.
      <br>
      <li><em>Development of high-performance reservoir simulation techniques</em> 
              <br>This involves leveraging cutting-edge technologies like MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA to craft advanced reservoir simulators. Additionally, I specialize in parallel performance analysis, utilizing tools like <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php/">TAU performance system</a> to optimize and enhance system efficiencies.
   </p>   
   <p style="text-align:justify">
   I am proficient in the Fortran programming language, which I actively apply in the modification and development of the TOUGH software suite, developed at <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. Within this domain, I've been extensively involved in the enhancement and parallelization of various TOUGH modules. Notably, I've played a significant role alongside Dr. Moridis in parallelizing <a href="https://tough.lbl.gov/software/tough-software/">TOUGH+RealGasBrine</a> and independently developed and parallelized a Particle Transport code, comprising over 10,000 lines of code.
