Welcome! My name is Tianjia Huang and I am a fourth years Ph.D student of petroleum engineering at Texas A&M University. My advisors are Prof. George Moridis and Prof. Thomas Blasingame.

<br><br>
My research focuses on numerical simulation of subsurface energy, such as geothermal, hydrogen storage, CCUS, and nuclear waste disposal. I am also interested in developing high-performance reservoir simulator, using MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA.
