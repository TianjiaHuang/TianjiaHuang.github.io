<font size="+2"><strong>High-performance Computing</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
   The idea behind parallel computing is to break a problem into smaller problems that can be solved simultaneously and independently. I am developing high-performance simulator using (a) MPI (b) OpenMP based on programming language FORTRAN. Besides, I am passionate about optimizing algorithms and performance analysis. Up to now, I parallelized an earlier version of the TOUGH+RealGasBrine code by using METIS partitioning software and the PETSc library. In addition, I parallelized the aforementioned particle transport code.

<font size="+2"><strong>Particle Transport in Porous Media (DEM)</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">The transport of small particles in unconsolidated hydrate-bearing media can cause significant problems. To accurately describe the dynamic system behavior during gas production from HBS, it is necessary to fully account for the numerous coupled processes, including particle transport, evolving during hydrate dissociation. A parallel particle transport code based on discrete element method (DEM) that can function as a stand-alone application  with independent data inputs, in addition to being seamlessly integrated with the reservoir simulation code, is developed independently by me.</p>

<font size="+2"><strong>Modeling of Subsurface Gas Flow</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Gas flow through the Earth is critically important in geological processes, such as volcanism, as well in subsurface engineering activities, such as nuclear waste disposal, carbon sequestration and hydrogen storage. Subsurface gas migration involves complex processes, including multiphase fluid flow with gas breakthrough, phase change expansion, pressure buildup, as well as potential gas fracturing with rapid gas release that could potentially be catastrophic. Through using and modifying the TOUGH+RealGasBrine, I investigate several topics, such as underground hydrogen storage and CCS.</p>

<font size="+2"><strong>Coupled Thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) Processes</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Deposal of high level nuclear wastes is developing and implementing safe geological repositories for all nuclear waste arising from the use of nuclear energy and from medicine, industry and research. Coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical numerical modeling is conducted to study such problem. Using and modifying TOUGH+RealGasBrine and FLAC3D, I investigate the temperature, pressure, and stress response associated with geologic disposal of high-level radioactive nuclear waste over 10,000 years. </p>
