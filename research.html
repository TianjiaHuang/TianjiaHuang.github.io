<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Drilling fluid invasion into hydrate-bearing sediments could induce hydrate dissociation and complicate heat and mass transfer around wellbore, and further affect mechanical strength of hydrate-bearing sediments and accurateness of wellbore logging interpretations. In this study, a cylindrical numerical model was established to study the characteristics of drilling fluid invasion into hydrate-bearing sediments and the effects of permeability on this process. The distributions of temperature, pressure, saturation, and salinity of pore water around wellbore at different time were obtained. The pressure and temperature around wellbore gradually increase, and the hydrate around wellbore dissociates with the high-temperature drilling fluid invasion. Meantime, water and gas generated from hydrate dissociation gradually migrate outward and then form ‘secondary hydrate’ in some areas outside wellbore. Dissociation and formation of hydrate can sharply change the salinity of pore water around wellbore. The drilling fluid invasion and hydrate dissociation ranges become larger when the intrinsic permeability is higher. The salinity in sediments decreases sharply while the dilution range is narrow when drilling fluid invasion into hydrate-bearing sediments with low permeability. In addition, the permeability decline exponent of the Masuda model has a significant influence on drilling fluid invasion. However, the Corey exponents of the relative permeability model only have a limited influence on drilling fluid invasion into hydrate-bearing sediments with low intrinsic permeability (e.g., 5.5 mD), while they have a noticeable influence on hydrate-bearing sediments with high intrinsic permeability (e.g., 75 mD).</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>Natural gas hydrate (NGH) is widely considered a potential alternative to traditional energy resources. Some countries are trying to exploit and utilize NGH. However, due to the sensitivity of the hydrate, and a lack of exploitation experience with the NGH, drilling in hydrate reservoirs is considered risky. In order to understand the disturbance effects of drilling fluid with different circulation rates on the hydrate-bearing sediments during the drilling process, a novel hydrate drilling experimental apparatus was used to study the drilling process in the hydrate-bearing sediments. Four drilling experiments were carried out in consolidated sediments containing Tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) hydrate. The drilling fluid injection rate ranges from 500 to 1800 g/min. The results show that hydrate dissociation can be induced by the circulation of relatively high-temperature drilling fluid when drilling in hydrate-bearing sediments, and that the hydrate dissociation rate is greatly influenced by the circulation rate of the drilling fluid. The drilling fluid invasion area has a maximum as the experiment progresses. Increasing the drilling fluid circulation rate can enhance the sediment temperature rise rate, enlarge the hydrate dissociation region, and increase cumulative TBAB production. Drilling fluid with a relatively low circulation rate is beneficial to wellbore stability. These findings will provide help with drilling design suitable for hydrate-bearing sediments, and provide a scientific basis for achieving safe drilling in hydrate-bearing sediments.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The unstable supply of renewable energy due to seasonal dependency contradicts the periodic energy demand. As hydrogen presents high energy density and flow mobility, and low solubility and residual saturation, underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising solution of scalable energy storage to rebalance energy demand and supply. Depleted gas reservoirs (DGR) are a suitable option for UHS due to their demonstrated integrity. In this study, we developed a numerical simulation model based on Tough + RealGasBrine (T + RGB) simulator to evaluate the feasibility of UHS in DGR. We calibrated different Equation-of-State (EOS) models for modeling the phase behavior of hydrogen-included mixtures with experimental data, and this further helps to examine the impact of various cushion gas pre-injection strategies on pressure maintenance and potential hydrogen leakage through cap-rock. After comparison among three EOS models, we adopted the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS in our simulations as its high accuracy and computational efficiency. Afterward, we simulated one hydrogen injection-idle-withdrawal operation in a high-resolution mesh based on a synthetic heterogeneous anticline DGR. We observed that hydrogen displaces pre-existing methane and resides at the top of the storage zone due to gravity segregation. The average pressure and gas saturation of the whole simulation domain increase with the hydrogen injection. With regard to the hydrogen leakage, when the cap-rock permeability ranges from 0.05% of the injected hydrogen at maximum leaks into the cap-rock while about 1% of injected hydrogen is dissolved into the aqueous phase. Those results demonstrate that DGR is a viable option for UHS. However, only about 73% of injected hydrogen can be recovered if the bottom-hole pressure of the production well is 2 MPa below the reservoir pressure. The cushion gas becomes necessary for the UHS project to increase hydrogen recovery. Injecting cushion gas of nitrogen and carbon dioxide increases hydrogen recovery from the initial 73%–91% and 81%, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate that nitrogen exhibits better performance, in terms of higher hydrogen recovery factor and purity of producing gas, as the cushion gas. In this work, we quantitatively evaluated the hydrogen leakage problem, including leakage into cap-rock, dissolution in water, and mixing with other gas components, which is the first-of-its-kind analysis in literature to the author's best knowledge. The simulation results support the feasibility of UHS in the DGR.</p><br>

<p style="text-align:justify"><b><i>Abstract: </i></b>The primary objective of this work are (a) to analyze the impact of salinity on the attempt to sequester CO2 in saline aquifers by means of vertical wells over long times—covering both the early short injection period and the subsequent long ‘rest’ period of inactivity—by determining its effect on key well and aquifer properties, conditions and rates of mass and heat transport, and (b) to investigate possible methods to mitigate the problems caused by salt precipitation (halite). We use a widely used numerical simulator that accounts for all the multiphase flow and transport processes associated with CO2 sequestration, including halite precipitation. The non-isothermal simulations use a high-definition cylindrical grid with radial subdivisions as small as 0.01 m in the vicinity of the well to accurately capture the critically importance effect of halite precipitation (the evolution and impact of which may be eluded when using coarser grids). Using two different well configurations of vertical wells, we inject CO2 as realistic rates into aquifers with varying salinity levels until a geomechanically safe maximum pressure is attained, and allow the system to rest for 100 yrs. During the entire simulation period, we monitor the evolutions of (a) pressures and temperatures in the near-well region and in the entire aquifer and (b) of mass and heat losses through the overburden. Additionally, we investigate possible methods to alleviate injectability problems caused by halite precipitation. The study shows that (a) wells completed in the entire aquifer depth are more effective in low-salinity aquifers, but shorter wells completed at the base of the aquifer are superior in high-salinity cases, (b) the storage potential of CO2 dissolved in the aqueous phase is limited (both in terms of the magnitude of the dissolved concentration and its spatial extent), and its benefit decreases rapidly with an increasing salinity, (c) salinity can have pronounced adverse effects on the well injectivity, as halite precipitation can cause severe blockage in the vicinity of the well and a rapid rise of the near well pressure to geomechanically unsafe levels, thus potentially reducing the usefulness of an aquifer as a CO2 storage facility and (d) the mitigation of the effects of precipitated halite in the well vicinity is a challenging endeavor, with concurrent H2O-CO2 injection being ineffective.</p><br>
