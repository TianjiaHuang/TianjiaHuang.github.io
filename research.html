<font size="+2"><strong>Underground Hydrogen Storage</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Underground hydrogen storage emerges as a promising solution to counterbalance the discord between fluctuating renewable energy generation and the constant demand for energy, especially in the context of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Utilizing subterranean structures like aquifers and depleted gas reservoirs offers a scalable, high-pressure, secure, cost-efficient, and eco-friendly means of hydrogen storage. Using TOUGH+RealGasBrine, I investigate several aspects regarding the hydrogen storage performance, including leakage into caprock, effect of cushion gas (N2, CO2, CH4), effect of reservoir sites and so on.</p>

<font size="+2"><strong>Nuclear Waste Disposal</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">Deposal of high level nuclear wastes is developing and implementing safe geological repositories for all nuclear waste arising from the use of nuclear energy and from medicine, industry and research. Coupled thermal-hydro-mechanical numerical modeling is conducted to study such problem. Using TOUGH+RealGasBrine and FLAC3D, I investigate the temperature, pressure, and stress response associated with geologic disposal of high-level radioactive nuclear waste over 10,000 years. </p>

<font size="+2"><strong>Particle Transport in Porous Media</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">The transport of small particles in unconsolidated hydrate-bearing media can cause significant problems. To accurately describe the dynamic system behavior during gas production from HBS, it is necessary to fully account for the numerous coupled processes, including particle transport, evolving during hydrate dissociation. A parallel particle transport code that can function as a stand-alone application  with independent data inputs, in addition to being seamlessly integrated with the pTH+M code, is developed independently by me.</p>

<font size="+2"><strong>Parallel Computing</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">The idea behind parallel computing is to break a problem into smaller problems that can be solved simultaneously and independently. I am developing high-performance simulator using (a) MPI (b) OpenMP based on programming language FORTRAN. I parallelized an earlier version of the TOUGH+RealGasBrine code by using METIS partitioning software and the PETSc library. In addition, I parallelized the aforementioned particle transport code.
