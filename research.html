<font size="+2"><strong>Underground Hydrogen Storage</strong></font>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify">
   Underground hydrogen storage emerges as a promising solution to counterbalance the discord between fluctuating renewable energy generation and the constant demand for energy, especially in the context of transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Utilizing subterranean structures like aquifers and depleted gas reservoirs offers a scalable, high-pressure, secure, cost-efficient, and eco-friendly means of hydrogen storage. Using TOUGH+RealGasBrine, I investigate several aspects regarding the hydrogen storage performance, including leakage into caprock, effect of cushion gas (N2, CO2, CH4), effect of reservoir sites and so on.
