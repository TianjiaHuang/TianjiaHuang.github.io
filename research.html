         The idea behind parallel computing is to break a problem into smaller problems that can be solved simultaneously and independently. I am developing high-performance simulator using (a) MPI (b) OpenMP based on programming language FORTRAN. Besides, I am passionate about optimizing algorithms and performance analysis. 
         With the help of advanced high-performance computing cluster, it is feasible to simulate coupling problems with (i) finer meshes and (ii) more complex physical processes.
         For instance, tracking the trajectory of several millions particles is a computationally intensive task.

         Particle transport in porous media constitutes a pivotal research area with far-reaching implications across various fields, including environmental science, petroleum engineering, and biotechnology.
         In petroleum engineering, the transport of small particles in unconsolidated hydrate-bearing sediment (HBS) can cause significant problems. To accurately describe the dynamic system behavior during gas production from HBS, it is necessary to fully account for the numerous coupled processes, including particle transport. 
         I independently developed a parallel particle transport code based on discrete element method (DEM) that can function as a stand-alone application  with independent data inputs, in addition to being seamlessly integrated with the reservoir simulation code. 
         The simulator can capture all processes involved in sand particle transport in porous media, including sand detachment, collision, clogging, and migration. The code exceeds 10,000 lines, including prefect functions for reading input files and outputting visual files

         Gas flow through the Earth is critically important in geological processes, such as volcanism, as well in subsurface engineering activities, such as geothermal, carbon sequestration and underground hydrogen storage. 
         Subsurface gas migration involves complex processes, including multiphase fluid flow with gas breakthrough, phase change expansion, pressure buildup, as well as potential gas fracturing with rapid gas release that could potentially be catastrophic.

         Research on coupled processes in geomechanics and underground engineering requires thermal-hydraulic-mechanical-chemical (THMC) coupled modeling. 
         For instance, deposal of high level nuclear wastes is developing and implementing safe geological repositories for all nuclear waste arising from the use of nuclear energy and from medicine, industry and research. 
         Coupled THMC numerical modeling is required to study such problem. I use TOUGH+FLAC3D to investigate the temperature, pressure, and stress response associated with geologic disposal of high-level radioactive nuclear waste over 10,000 years.

         I also conduct research on the following topics. Due to time and energy constraint, they are more of a competency than an object of my in-depth investigation.

            <li>Mesh Construction
               <br>I use Gmsh to create some mesh with specific purpose or complicated structure, such as Discrete Fractures Network (DFN) mesh.

               <br>Although parallelization can significantly speed up the computation of particle transport problem, the computational cost of utilizing DEM for sand production simulation remains considerable.
               In such scenarios, emerging technologies like machine learning may prove beneficial in reducing computational expenses; my simulator can serve as a valuable tool for generating sufficient input data for training machine learning models.
